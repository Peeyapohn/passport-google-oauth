## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/): Make sure you have Node.js and npm installed on your system.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd <project-folder>
   ```

3. Install project dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Create a `.env` file in the project root and configure the environment variables. You can use the `.env.example` file as a template.

5. Start the application:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

6. Open your web browser and visit `http://localhost:3000` to access the application.

## Project Structure

The project structure is organized as follows:

- `app.js`: The main entry point of the application.
- `routes/`: Contains route definitions.
- `views/`: Contains view templates using the EJS templating engine.
- `public/`: Includes static assets like CSS, JavaScript, and images.
- `var/db/`: The directory where the SQLite database for sessions is stored.
- `.env.example`: An example environment variable configuration file.
- `.gitignore`: Gitignore file to exclude sensitive files and folders.

## Configuration

You can configure the application by creating an `.env` file based on the provided `.env.example` template. Define environment variables in the `.env` file, such as the secret key and database configurations.

## Routes

The application has two main routes:

- `/`: The main application route, which displays a welcome page.
- `/auth`: Authentication routes for Passport.js, including login, logout, and Google OAuth.

You can customize and expand the routes by adding new route files in the `routes/` directory.
